# The _etc_ repo

This repo tracks System configurations used on various Machines. Where the
_dotfiles_ repository tracks files in my /home environment, the _etc_ repository
tracks files kept in /etc that configure System-wide software. The two together
will allow me to track a personal Workspace and configurations for a System.

Why do I track /etc files?
- **X11 and the Xorg display server** can be configured for various Device
  drivers and Monitors. Displays determine characteristics of the output (ie.
  colour depth and bits-per-pixel), Screens bridge all of the previous together,
  and ServerLayouts couple one or more Screens with one or more InputDevices to
  result in a complete configuration. I may encounter a need to mix-and-match
  any Machine, Monitor and Peripherals.
